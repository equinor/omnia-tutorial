This slide show is written in rst and designed to be generated as an HTML site
using Hovercraft_. See `README.rst <..\..\README.rst>`__ for details on where 
you can view an automatically generated version.

You can render this presentation to HTML with the command::

    hovercraft introduction.rst output/introduction

And then view the output/introduction/index.html file to see how it turned out.

You separate slides with a line that consists of four or more dashes. The
first slide will start at the first such line, or at the first heading. Since
none of the text so far has been a heading, it means that the first slide has
not yet started. As a result, all this text will be ignored in the generated 
output.
